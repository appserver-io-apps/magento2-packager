     | If you want to use MySQL please be aware, that you have to tweak the configuration,
     | for example in file /etc/my.cnf, to optimize performance, especially for import
     | purposes. Please make sure, that you have the following values set:
     |
     | [mysqld]
     | wait_timeout = 5
     | max_connections = 2000
     | max_user_connections = 2000
     |
     | This is very important, as Doctrine which we are using as ORM in that example,
     | has not been build to run in multithreaded environment and therefore has to
     | create a connection for every database call.
     |
     | These values are only recommended for this example and can differ a lot from
     | a real production environment!
